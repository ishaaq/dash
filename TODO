Stuff I'd like to do to enhance dash (in no particular order) along with broad complexity estimate (TRIVIAL/MEDIUM/HARD)

1. Tab-completion on commands (MEDIUM)
2. :globals command - lists all global vars/functions in session (TRIVIAL)
3. :describe command - describes a javascript var/function/object - may also show help if implemented (MEDIUM)
4. Tab-completion of javascript object properties (MEDIUM)
5. Ability to dynamically inject tab-completion strategies via javascript - this will enable scripts to define custom
   tab-completion, for e.g. to complete the input variables for a given function. (HARD)
6. Investigate if java protection domains can be used to tighten security model to ensure that certain commands cannot
   be run on Server, for e.g. System.exit(). However we need to be careful not to affect the security model of the
   original code in the app. (HARD)
7. Investigate how to get MINA to unbind the server socket after client and server connect - so that no other app can
   then communicate with dash. (MEDIUM)
8. Write script(s) with "best-practice" examples - i.e. explain the JavaScript module pattern 
   http://www.wait-till-i.com/2007/07/24/show-love-to-the-module-pattern/ (MEDIUM)
9. build process for distribution tarball (MEDIUM)
10. Use something like jarjar to rename dash's deps so we don't have classloader clashes when the app being attached
    to already has differing versions of the deps (MEDIUM)
11. Deal with stacktraces a bit better when errors are thrown by javascript code - currently the traces are useless as
    they all originate from Rhino code and do not display the actual error stack.
